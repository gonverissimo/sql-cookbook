# DataWarehouse Analytics Project

## This **Data Analytics** project explores business performance through sales data, customer behaviors and product insights using **T-SQL**. It simulates how a data analyst would extract and analyze information in a corporate environment using structured, warehouse-ready data.

The primary goal of this project was to **enhance my skills as a Data Analyst** by applying advanced SQL techniques in a realistic business scenario.
The focus was on building robust SQL queries by leveraging Common Table Expressions (CTEs) for clean logic structuring, applying window functions for advanced row-wise calculations, performing meaningful aggregations and conducting insightful customer and product segmentation.

This hands-on project allowed me to:
- Practice **SQL data exploration**, transformation, and KPI calculation.
- Analyze large-scale transactional data to extract insights.
- Simulate a real-world data analytics workflow, from data ingestion to reporting logic.

## Data Import

The project began by importing data from **three CSV files** into SQL Server:

- `gold.dim_customers`
- `gold.dim_products`
- `gold.fact_sales`

Once the data was loaded, it was cleaned and prepared for analysis.
